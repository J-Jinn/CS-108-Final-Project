Run gui.py for Tkinter version and myFlaskApp.py for web app version.

I did create a requirements.txt file which should provide a list of all the packages involved.

Didn't get around to implementing database functionality using Node.js and other packages.
Was more involved than I thought at first (and would need SQL Server to run it).

Files are located in "model" and "app" folders.
Also modified generation_utils.py (located in the huggingface_transformers/src/transformers folder)

Project currently utilizes a specific committed version of the HuggingFace-Transformers Repository.
Hence, included with project submission.  Pulling new changes from remote master may/will break things.

Virtual environment utilizes Python 3.8.
